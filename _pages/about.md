Welcome to my academic corner!  I’m currently a Lecturer at the Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering (Institute of Systems Information Science), Kyushu University, where I also earned my Ph.D. in Economics in 2021. My research journey in labor economics has led me to explore fascinating intersections of social norms, labor participation, returns to education, and gender gaps. Currently, I'm diving deep into the realms of inequality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility.

Research is exhilarating, but the feedback loop can be lengthy. When I'm not immersed in academic pursuits, you might find me enjoying manga or video games, crafting and creating, or experimenting in the kitchen. And yes, like many academics, I've perfected the art of room organization as a "productive" form of pre-writing preparation!

If you're intrigued by my research or just want to chat about the best manga/video game for the season, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to research collaborations, academic discussions, or even sharing cleaning tips!
